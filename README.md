## Project Description

Plan With Love is a simple **React** application created for learning purposes. It provides a clean and minimal UI to display plans stored locally in the browser. Users can delete plans and refresh the list. The app focuses on practicing React fundamentals such as component structure, state management, localStorage handling, and basic UI updates without any backend or complex features.

## 📦 How It Works

1. On load, the app fetches plans stored in `localStorage`.  
2. Plans are displayed in a list with options to delete each item.  
3. Users can refresh the page or list to see updated data.  
4. All data operations update `localStorage` accordingly.
